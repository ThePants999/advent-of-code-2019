# Advent of Code 2019 - Rust
My Rust solutions to all [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) problems. I'm new to Rust, but I've learned a whole lot in this process, and I'd like to think there's _some_ value to someone out there in seeing how I've done it.

My style prioritises being easy to follow, understand and reason about.  So you'll typically see a lot _more_ code here than with some other people's solutions - this isn't the place to come to learn how to write really tight, concise Rust that does a lot in few lines.  With the occasional exception, I generally haven't sacrificed much in the way of performance, though. Day 6 is a good example of this.
## Current status
I've completed the Advent of Code, but only the days with times listed in the table below are currently in a state where they're worth looking at (and 18 takes nearly three minutes to execute, so you probably don't want to look at that one ðŸ˜†). I'm continuing to work on fixing up the other days.

Running times (best quartile) on my machine:

| Day | Time (ms) |
| --- | --------- |
| 1   | 0.1       |
| 2   | 9         |
| 3   | 0.3       |
| 4   | 48        |
| 5   | 0.1       |
| 6   | 13        |
| 7   | 72        |
| 8   | 0.25      |
| 9   | 5         |
| 10  | 10        |
| 11  | 12        |

| 13  | 23        |
| 14  | 0.5       |
| 15  | 6         |
| 16  | 84        |

| 18  | 165978 ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) |
| 19  | 33        |
| 20  | ~1700     |
| 21  | 11        |
